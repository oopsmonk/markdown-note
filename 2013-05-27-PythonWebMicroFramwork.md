#Web Micro Framework Battle  

##WSGI Micro Framworks  
這陣子一直在找適合的Micro Framwork做為第一次的Web Application開發.  
以下是由[WSGI.org][]列出的Micro [Framwork][].  

* [bobo][]  
    Bobo is a light-weight framework. Its goal is to be easy to use and remember.

* [Bottle][]  
    Bottle is a fast and simple micro-framework for small web-applications. It offers request dispatching (Routes) with url parameter support, Templates, key/value Databases, a build-in HTTP Server and adapters for many third party WSGI/HTTP-server and template engines. All in a single file and with no dependencies other than the Python Standard Library.

* [Flask][]  
    Flask is a microframework for Python based on Werkzeug, Jinja 2 and good intentions.
    It inherits its high WSGI usage and compliance from Werkzeug.

* [Pyramid][]  
    Merger of the Pylons and repoze.bfg projects, Pyramid is a minimalist web framework aiming at composability and making developers paying only for what they use.
    
* [web.py][]  
    Makes web apps. A small RESTful library.
